Distinctiveness and Complexity
Why you believe your project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements:
This project aims to develop a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system using Django, a high-level Python web framework. The project demonstrates distinctiveness and complexity through several aspects:

Custom User Authentication: The project implements custom user authentication using Django's built-in authentication system. It allows users to register, log in, log out, and restricts access to certain views based on authentication status.

CRUD Functionality: The application provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for customer records. Users can view, add, update, and delete customer records, which are stored in the database.

Bootstrap Integration: Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript are utilized for frontend design and interactivity, enhancing the user experience with responsive and visually appealing components.

Forms and Models: Django forms are used for user registration and adding/updating records, ensuring data validation and security. Django models define the structure of the database, facilitating data manipulation and retrieval.

Messages Framework: The Django messages framework is employed to display feedback messages to users, informing them about successful operations, errors, or authentication requirements.

URL Routing: The urls.py file contains URL patterns mapped to corresponding view functions, enabling proper routing of HTTP requests to appropriate endpoints.

Readability and Maintainability: Code readability is emphasized through clear variable names, comments, and adherence to PEP 8 conventions. The project structure follows Django's recommended layout, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

File Descriptions
views.py: Contains view functions responsible for handling HTTP requests, processing data, and rendering HTML templates. Functions such as user authentication, CRUD operations, and logging out are implemented here.

urls.py: Defines URL patterns for mapping to view functions. Each URL pattern is associated with a specific view, enabling navigation within the application.

forms.py: Defines Django forms for user registration (SignUpForm) and adding/updating records (AddRecordForm). These forms specify fields, validation rules, and widgets for data entry.

models.py: Contains Django model classes representing database tables. The Record model defines fields for storing customer records, such as name, email, phone number, etc.

HTML Templates: Located in the templates directory, HTML templates are used to generate dynamic web pages. Templates include index.html (home page), register.html (user registration form), record.html (displaying customer record details), add_record.html (form for adding new records), update_record.html (form for updating existing records).

How to Run the Application
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

Ensure Python and Django are installed on your system.
Clone the project repository from GitHub.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Install project dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run migrations to create the database schema using python manage.py migrate.
Start the Django development server with python manage.py runserver.
Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:8000/.
Additional Information
This project serves as a basic CRM system prototype and can be extended with additional features such as user roles, search functionality, data visualization, etc.
Security considerations such as password hashing, input sanitization, and CSRF protection are implemented as per Django's security best practices.
Continuous integration (CI) and deployment (CD) pipelines can be set up to automate testing and deployment processes for production environments.
Feedback and contributions are welcome via GitHub pull requests and issues.
